some one sent you this and you ran it? heres out to stop the ransomware from infecting you
 
🛑 1. Don’t open or run the file
If you haven’t double-clicked it yet, delete it now. Simply downloading it doesn’t usually cause harm, but running it can.
🖥️ 2. If you did open it, let’s assume the worst
Here’s how to check for issues:
Disconnect from the internet to stop potential malware from communicating with outside servers.
Run a full scan with Windows Security or your preferred antivirus. You can find it by typing “Windows Security” in your Start Menu → go to Virus & threat protection → Full scan.
Consider using Malwarebytes (free version works great) for an extra layer of detection: malwarebytes.com
🔐 3. Change important passwords
Just in case, change your Discord, email, and any banking or gaming passwords from a different device you trust.
🧹 4. Clean up suspicious items
If the scan finds anything, follow the recommended steps to quarantine or delete it. Don’t ignore any “potentially unwanted” software.
📌 5. Report it
Report the sender on Discord. Go to their profile, click the three dots (•••), and select Report. Discord does take action on scams like this.
